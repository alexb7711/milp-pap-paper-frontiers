    Robust charging schedules for an increasing interest of battery electric bus (BEB) fleets is a critical component to
    successful adoption. In this paper, a BEB charging scheduling framework that considers spatiotemporal schedule
    constraints, route schedules, fast and slow charging, and battery dynamics is modeled as a mixed integer linear
    program (MILP). The MILP is modeled after the berth allocation problem (BAP) in a modified form known as the position
    allocation problem (PAP). Linear battery dynamics are included to model the charging and discharging of buses while at
    the station and during their routes, respectively. The optimization coordinates BEB charging to ensure each BEB has
    sufficient charge while using slow chargers where possible for sake of battery health. The model also minimizes the
    total number of chargers utilized and prioritizes slow chargers. The model validity is demonstrated with a set of
    routes sampled from \TODO{Utah Transit Authority (UTA)} for \A buses and \N visits to the charging station. The model
    is also compared to a threshold based algorithm, referred to as the Quin-Modified method. The results presented show
    that the slow chargers are more readily selected and the charging and spatiotemporal constraints are met while
    considering the battery dynamics, minimizing the charger count, and consumption cost.
