    Robust charging schedules in a growing market of battery electric bus (BEB) fleets are a critical component to
    successful adoption. In this paper, a BEB charging scheduling framework that considers spatiotemporal schedule
    constraints, route schedules, fast and slow charging, and battery dynamics is modeled as a mixed integer linear
    program (MILP). The MILP is modeled after the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP) in a modified form known as the Position
    Allocation Problem (PAP). Linear battery dynamics are included to model the charging of buses while at the station.
    \textcolor{blue}{To model the BEB discharges over their respective routes, it is assumed each BEB has an average kWh
      charge loss while on route.} The optimization coordinates BEB charging to ensure that each vehicle
    \textcolor{blue}{remains above a specified state-of-charge (SOC)}. The model also minimizes the total number of
    chargers utilized and prioritizes slow \textcolor{blue}{charging} for battery health. The model validity is
    demonstrated with a set of routes sampled from the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) for \A buses and \N visits to the
    charging station. The model is also compared to a heuristic algorithm based on charge thresholds referred to as the
    Qin-Modified method. The results presented show that the slow chargers are more readily selected and the charging and
    spatiotemporal constraints are met while considering the battery dynamics and minimizing both the charger count and
    consumption cost.
