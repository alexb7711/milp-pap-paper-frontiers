\maketitle

Thank you for thoroughly reviewing our manuscript and providing us the opportunity to revise and resubmit another
version of our manuscript. The comments provided a perspective that was essential to the improvement of the work's
quality. We have addressed all the suggestions made by the reviewer. The changes are represented by blue text
embedded within the manuscript. Below is a point-by-point response to the reviewers comments are presented. Relevant
sections are mentioned when applicable to assist in searching for the associated changes.

\section{Reviewer's Comments to the Authors}
The work proposes a novel approach to BEB charger scheduling, investigating different methodologies to evaluate charger utilization and energy consumption. The topic covered is very interesting and deeply analyzed by the authors.
Before final publication, I suggest that the authors consider addressing the following points identified during the review process:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide a brief description of MILP, BAP, and PAP in the abstract.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Include results, even in percentage terms, in the abstract, comparing the Qin-modified method with the proposed one.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item From lines 31 to 34: move the introduction to the activity to the end of the section, after the background.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item As in line 48, please update the references throughout the document to include more recent works.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item From lines 110 to 114: to improve comprehension of the problem, add a table to summarize the data introduced.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Revise the sentence at lines 187-188 for clarity.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item In section 4.1, provide a table for all the data used for the case study.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Justify the choice of a minimum SOC at the end of the day being equal to 70%. Is there any reference for this? Would it be more realistic to use a different value?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Line 322: figures 7a and 7b do not depict SOC
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extend the conclusions to provide a broader description, including the percentage variation between the two cases in terms of results.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Referring to line 356: is it possible to avoid the SOC drop to 0% in the Qin-Modified methodology?
\end{itemize}
